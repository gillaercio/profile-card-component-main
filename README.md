## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took advantage of this project to practice the use of **background-position** and **background-size** with multiple images:

Multiple images in the background

```css
background-image: url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
 url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: 275% 275%, -175% -175%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-size: 125% 125%, 125% 125%;
  background-attachment: fixed, fixed;
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve the use of the **HTML** and **CSS**.
